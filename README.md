# Arduino-Vending-Machine
Arduino Mini Vending Machine with Coin Selector, Keypad, and Servo Motors

## Repository Description
This Arduino-based project transforms a simple setup into a functional mini vending machine. The system utilizes a coin selector for payment validation, a keypad for item selection, and four servo motors to dispense items. The project is ideal for hobbyists, students, and makers looking to explore the intersection of hardware and software through practical application. Detailed instructions, schematics, and code are included to guide you through building your own mini vending machine.

Features:

- Coin Selector: Accepts coins to process payments.
- Keypad Input: Allows users to select items by entering a code.
- Servo Motors: Four servo motors are used to dispense selected items.
- Arduino Control: Central control using an Arduino board for reliable operation.
